# Description 
 This project is all about using routes in a server.js file to retrieve or send data based on apis and it's "get" or "post" method. You're able to add notes, or view them individually, and they're stored in a db.json file. Each note is given a unique ID upon creation, and stored in an array. I was in charge of creating the routes using express.js and developing the middleware, also based upon express.js.
